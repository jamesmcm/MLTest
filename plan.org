* Obtaining data
** OpenCV works with suitable webcam
** May need to consider other sources - i.e. CCTV as flash video, etc.
* Image matching
** OpenCV uses contour detection to get digit boundaries
** No angle fixing implemented yet
* Image manipulation
** OpenCV drops to binary image quite nicely
** Pylab handles enlarging of necessary images (may also need shrinking)
** Could implement superresolution?
** Cropping not yet implemented
* Digit identification
** Scikit SVM failed with 1 training set
** Currently use pixel testing but want method that can sum evidence
** SVM may be better in the long run, for different sizes/orientation
** Also consider neural networks, Markov models,  maybe Gaussian processes?
** Currently require separate classifier for every size
* Recombining data
** Each digit is identified successfully, this should be trivial

* Plan:
* TODO perhaps highlight selected contour
* TODO Add code for additional digit passes
* TODO Crop image by clicking two points
* TODO Finish setting parameter redraws
* TODO Add click modes
* TODO Make hitting escape clear click mode
* TODO Make tag popup
* TODO Add contour by clicking two points
* TODO Remove contour by clicking with in
* TODO Split contour by clicking at split point
* TODO Add code for automatically splitting merged digits
* TODO Add ability to crop image and store that
* TODO Split in to separate files
* TODO Draw contours directly in colour using numpy
* TODO Intelligently set window sizes - allow resize?
* TODO Don't resize but use zoom with toolbar
* TODO Bypass segfaulting using numpy imshow and keypress as in tesiapp
* TODO Better way of getting full training set - perhaps via frames?
* TODO Wire up monitor config
* TODO Change scale on colourbars to fit
* TODO Include variation of more parameters
* TODO Fix segfaulting on any imshow() - need this for test/training sets
* TODO Find some way of solving merged number problem
* TODO Use running average of frames to determine likely correct digits and known number of digits
* DONE Add using line conoturs to remove bg that is in rectangle of digit
* DONE Use starting position of contour to eliminate side noise contours
* TODO Sort out functions
* DONE Look up how to do live capture
* DONE Sort out threshold
* DONE Find position for camera
* DONE To get out of bubble writing - take contours, then not the contours and then split the digits
* TODO Clearly separate training from image set, from live testing functions
* DONE Write method which sums up pixel appearance in training set, then sums scores over this for test set
** Can plot classifier as grey-scale image somehow
* DONE Write code in to functions/classes
* TODO Write function which displays contours, asks for digit shown/invalid
* TODO Write function to get webcam live
* DONE Set up external webcam
* TODO Write script for getting more training sets
** Use cropping to take contours left to right (eliminating bad aspect ratio, noise, etc.), then can automate with known examples
** This may not be possible in Mexico though
* TODO Try other classification methods
** Retry SVM?
** Get at least one evidence-summing approach to work
* TODO Try implementing super-resolution imaging
* TODO Investigate use of multiple cameras
* TODO Investigate image matching
* TODO Investigate limiting size, noise, etc.
* DONE Make more realistic simulation of machine (PyGame?)
* TODO Test data logging in real-time - need fixed position
* TODO Write documents
** We need also to write the manual, limitation, regulation, adventages, disvantages, etc
* TODO Difficult problems
** Unknown number of digits i.e. 70->140
** Kerning pushing digits together?
** Cannot vary size and spacing in reality
** How to obtain training set in reality
