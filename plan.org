* Obtaining data
** OpenCV works with suitable webcam
** May need to consider other sources - i.e. CCTV as flash video, etc.
* Image matching
** OpenCV uses contour detection to get digit boundaries
** No angle fixing implemented yet
* Image manipulation
** OpenCV drops to binary image quite nicely
** Pylab handles enlarging of necessary images (may also need shrinking)
** Could implement superresolution?
** Cropping not yet implemented
* Digit identification
** Scikit SVM failed with 1 training set
** Currently use pixel testing but want method that can sum evidence
** SVM may be better in the long run, for different sizes/orientation
** Also consider neural networks, Markov models,  maybe Gaussian processes?
** Currently require separate classifier for every size
* Recombining data
** Each digit is identified successfully, this should be trivial

* Plan:
* DONE Write method which sums up pixel appearance in training set, then sums scores over this for test set
** Can plot classifier as grey-scale image somehow
* DONE Write code in to functions/classes
* TODO Write script for getting more training sets
** Use cropping to take contours left to right (eliminating bad aspect ratio, noise, etc.), then can automate with known examples
** This may not be possible in Mexico though
* TODO Try other classification methods
** Retry SVM?
** Get at least one evidence-summing approach to work
* TODO Try implementing super-resolution imaging
* TODO Investigate use of multiple cameras
* TODO Investigate image matching
* TODO Investigate limiting size, noise, etc.
* TODO Make more realistic simulation of machine (PyGame?)
* TODO Test data logging in real-time - need fixed position
* TODO Write documents
** We need also to write the manual, limitation, regulation, adventages, disvantages, etc
